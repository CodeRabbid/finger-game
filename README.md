# Welcome to Finger-Game repo

The project is deployed on Render, [here is the link](https://finger-game.onrender.com/)

Just create an simple account and choose an opponent to play with!

To run the project locally, first install dependencies and start the server:

```sh
cd server && npm install
```

```sh
cd server && npm start
```

, and then the same with the client:

```sh
cd client && npm install
```

```sh
cd client && npm start
```

Have fun!
